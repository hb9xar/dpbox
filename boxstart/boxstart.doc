Short documentation for boxstart
--------------------------------
(Mark Wahl, DL4YBG, last update 08.02.96)

'boxstart' is a kind of watchdog-program, which checks frequently, if all
programs of your TNT/DPBox-configuration are still running. If not, the
missing programs will be restarted.

The function of boxstart is quite simple. TNT, DPBox and TFKISS put their
own process-id in a file. Now boxstart checks for this file for each of the
programs. Several cases are possible:

1. program was never run
   No pid-file is found -> start program
2. program exited by error (segmentation fault)
   pid-file is existing, but process is not active -> start program
3. program exited because of ordinary termination
   pid-file was erased -> start program
4. program still running
   pid-file found and process still running -> do nothing

Now boxstart needs the information where the pid-file can be found and which
program shall be started, if the pid-file was not found or the process was
not active.
This information must be put into 'boxstart.ini', line by line for each
program you want to watch.

Sample boxstart.ini:
# process-id file for first program
/work2/box/stat/dpbox.pid
# first program
/work2/dpbox/dpbox
# process-id file for second program
/work/tnt/tnt.pid
# second program
/work2/tnt/tnt -u </dev/tty7 >/dev/tty7 &
<EOF>

In the sample file you see that TNT is using an empty tty for stdout/stdin
and is started as a background process. So you don't block a login-console
with TNT. But it is important that no getty-process is running on this tty.
In addition it is advisable to give a '-u' in the tnt-command-line. Otherwise
you will not be able to restart tnt after a crash because of the lockfile!

Now you are able to generate your own config-file. Be sure that all paths
and filenames are consistant with the configuration-files of TNT, DPBox and
TFKISS, otherwise accidently a program can be started more than once.

boxstart itself terminates after one run through the config-file. Therefore
it must be put into a cron-job. You can use therefore 'crontab -e' or simply
add the following lines to your crontab-file
(usually in /usr/spool/cron/crontabs/root):

# Run the 'boxstart' program every 5 minutes
0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * *      /work2/boxstart/boxstart -i /work2/boxstart/boxstart.ini

Surely you must update the paths to the directory where boxstart resides on
your system.
